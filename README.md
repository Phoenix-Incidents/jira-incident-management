## ðŸ§  Why Phoenix Incidents
Unlike standalone tools such as incident.io, Phoenix Incidents enhances the tools your engineers already live in â€” Jira, Slack, PagerDuty, Victorops and more. With Phoenix Incidents you get best-practice workflows, automated communications, guided RCAs, and post-incident action items that actually get prioritized by your team.

It is only Jira-native incident management and response platform.

Some key features:
* Incidents are created as Jira issues â€” right next to your teamsâ€™ bugs and stories.
* Responders coordinate wherever they are: Slack/Teams, Jira or PagerDuty/VictorOps.
* Verification, updates, RCA, and remediation follow-through are automated.
* A fully guided RCA process replaces Confluence templates with in-Jira workflows.
* Analytics track MTTA, MTTR, severities, causes, and follow-up SLAs.
* Convention over configuration â€” your team can get started in minutes.
